## Setup
Perform the following setup to run the code.
- All setup steps should be completed from the topmost directory
- Using a venv is recommended

Install packages in requirements.txt to build the model with the correct version:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

To make code imports cleaner across multiple directories, packages were used in conjunction with setuptools. To create the package:
- pip install -e .

## TODO
- Make scripts terminal based so that results are easily replicable.
- Write a proper readme with use instructions once the previous tasks are complete.
